A production-intensive course in applied theory and practice of developing
web-based applications, emphasizing interface and experience design using HTML5,
CSS3, and the DOM; and backend development using Ruby-based web application
frameworks. Students will learn agile, modular development techniques grounded
in open-source technologies, including Ubuntu Linux, version control (Git),
jQuery, and Ruby on Rails. Note: students should take [COM 530: Standards-Based
Web Design](http://courses.karlstolley.com/530/) or have a solid command of Web
standards (especially XHTML 1.0 Strict and CSS 1 and 2) prior to enrolling in
this course.

## Course Goals

* Develop strong abilities in using JavaScript and jQuery or another JavaScript
  library/framework for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)
* Learn and employ agile development methods for front- and back-end design
* Become familiar with Ruby development frameworks and the Model-View-Controller
  (MVC) architecture
* Connect course content to principles and practices in technical communication
  and information architecture
* Apply course concepts and adjust/extend course projects to fit your own
  academic and professional interests

### Attendance and Participation
Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success
in the class, and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you
absolutely must miss, please contact me ahead of time via email.

### Academic Honesty
As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold the Code of Academic
Honesty (p. 48 of the IIT Graduate Bulletin 2010-2012). All work for this course
should be your own original effort, including print and digital page design and
computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly
cited as legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate.

If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole
or in part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me
immediately and before the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty
are severe. Any student who violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be
subject to expulsion from this course with a failing grade, and I will report
the student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities and the Associate Dean
of Graduate Academic Affairs, who may take additional disciplinary action.

### Special Needs Statement
Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented
disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter
of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The Center for
Disability Resources (CDR) is located in Life Sciences Room 218. Contact the
Center by telephone at 312-567-5744 or via email at disabilities@iit.edu

Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might
affect their ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in
person or via email, at the start of the semester. Methods, materials, or
deadlines will be adapted as required to ensure equitable participation.
